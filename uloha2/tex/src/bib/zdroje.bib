ABSTRACT = {Permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motors (PMSRMs) have been widely used in household appliances, national defense and the military, due to their advantages of low cost and high efficiency. However, their excessive torque ripple cause a series of problems, such as high vibration and noise. To solve this problem, this paper first considers the important factor that causes the torque ripple&mdash;the cogging torque. Firstly, the generating principle of the cogging torque is analyzed, and a method combining magnetic pole migration and the stator auxiliary groove is proposed. On this basis, considering the position, width, depth, quantity and shape of the auxiliary groove, the Taguchi method is used to optimize the proposed improved structure. Finally, a new motor structure that can minimize torque ripple is obtained. Compared with the original structure, the cogging torque is reduced by 57.6%, the torque ripple is reduced by 38%, and the electromagnetic torque is only reduced by 1.6%.},
