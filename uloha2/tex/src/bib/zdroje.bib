    abstractNote = {Abstract The design and optimisation of a permanent
                    magnet‐assisted synchronous reluctance (PMaSynR) traction
                    machine is described to improve its energy efficiency over a
                    selection of driving cycles, when installed on a
                    four‐wheel‐drive electrically powered vehicle for urban use,
                    with two on‐board powertrains. The driving cycle‐based
                    optimisation is defined with the objective of minimising
                    motor energy loss under strict size constraints, while
                    maintaining the peak torque and restricting the torque
                    ripple. The key design parameters that exert the most
                    significant influence on the selected performance indicators
                    are identified through a parametric sensitivity analysis. The
                    optimisation brings a motor design that is characterised by
                    an energy loss reduction of 8.2% over the WLTP Class 2
                    driving cycle and 11.7% over the NEDC and Artemis Urban
                    driving cycles, at the price of a 4.7% peak torque reduction
                    with respect to the baseline machine. Additional analysis,
                    implemented outside the optimisation framework, revealed that
                    different coil turn adjustments would reduce the energy loss
                    along the considered driving cycles. However, under realistic
                    size constraints, the optimal design solutions are the same.},

             Amount of Permanent Magnet},

    abstractNote = {This paper analyzes the performance of a synchronous
                    reluctance motor (SynRM) equipped with a limited amount of a
                    permanent magnet (PM). This is conventionally implemented by
                    inserting PMs in rotor flux barriers, and this is often
                    called the PM-assisted SynRM (PMa-SynRM). However, common
                    PMa-SynRMs could be vulnerable to irreversible
                    demagnetization. Therefore, motor performance and PM
                    demagnetization should be simultaneously considered, and this
                    would require the PM to be properly arranged. In this paper,
                    various rotor configurations are carefully studied and
                    compared in order to maximize the motor performance, avoid
                    irreversible demagnetization and achieve higher PM
                    utilization. Moreover, the field weakening capability is
                    investigated and improved by regulating armature excitation.
                    A particular rotor type with flux intensification was found
                    to possess higher PM utilization, lower demagnetization
                    possibility with fairly high performance. Thus, suitable
                    rotor configurations are recommended for certain
                    applications.},
