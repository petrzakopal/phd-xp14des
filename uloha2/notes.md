# Design
- robustness, high overload capability, and low cost
- the torque/power density and power factor of SynRMs are relatively low and this is disadvantageous to electric vehicle (EV) traction applications
- Therefore, permanent magnets (PMs) may be inserted into the SynRM rotor core to improve the performance
